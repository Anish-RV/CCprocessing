For this coding problem, I decided to create a Card class to store the information regarding the credit card, including name, card number, balance and credit limit. To access the required card, I am using a HashMap where the key is the card holder's name and the value is the card itself.
I picked Java as it is the programming language I am most comfortable with using.
No special setup is required to run my code. You can simply run it from the command line. For the tests, you would need to install JUnit 4 or Junit 5. 
Looking forward to hearing your feedback and about the next steps in the interview process!
